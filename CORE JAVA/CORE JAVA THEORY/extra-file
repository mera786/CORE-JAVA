(1) what is factory design pattern ?
-> The Factory Design Pattern is a way to create objects in Java without telling the exact class name to the client (user).
✅ Real-life Example:
Imagine you go to a car factory and say: "I want a car." , You don’t say: "Make me a Honda or a Toyota."
Note: The factory decides which car to build, depending on your request or need

(2)  What is Abstract Factory Design Pattern?
-> It is a factory of factories.
-> It provides a way to create families of related objects without specifying their exact classes.
✅ Simple Real-Life Example: 
Imagine you have two companies:
Apple (makes: Mac, iPhone)
Samsung (makes: Galaxy Laptop, Galaxy Phone)
Now, you want a factory that can give you both a phone and a laptop, but from the same brand.
You don't ask:
"Give me iPhone and Galaxy Laptop"
Instead you say:
"Give me a full product set from Apple"
or
"Give me a full product set from Samsung".
That’s what Abstract Factory does.
